Hi everyone, now is 01/01/2025 and is a first day in the year so happy new year UwU

I've been having some issues with my old blogâ€”it doesn't offer many features. So, I've decided to switch to Jekyll! It's not only beautiful and easy to use, but it also comes with way more functionality. Thank you for reading! My old Blogspot site will still be updated occasionally, but let's be honestâ€”it won't look as good as this one. ðŸ˜†
